        createFAQobject('What is Sparrow?' , 'Sparrow is an online marketplace that connects freelance labor of college students with local demand, allowing clients to get an extra hand with everyday tasks. College students face great responsibilities with academics, work, social life, and athletic commitments. Many students can not fully commit to their academics and are often compelled to prioritize work in order to attend college. Over 70% of college students rely on a job to finance their education with living expenses, tuition, and student debt at a record high. It is not only complicated for students to find flexible work that aligns with their schedule, but most available jobs pay only minimum wage. Thus, Sparrow intends to support and help every college student obtain academic success by making work more flexible.'),

We perform an identity and criminal background check of every student and client on the platform. Students are also verified by their college and will only be allowed to sign up using their school email. Consequently, students who are found in misconduct violation per Sparrowâ€™s policy will be banned from the platform and will be unable to sign up again.
