                <h3>1. The Spaarrow Platform Connects Students and Clients
                </h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Spaarrow Platform is a web- and app-based two-sided marketplace which enables connections between Clients and Students.“Clients”  are individuals and/or businesses seeking to obtain short-term services ( “Tasks” ) from Students and are therefore clients of Students, and “Students” are businesses seeking to perform Tasks for Clients. Clients and Students together are hereinafter referred to as “Users.”  If you agree on the terms of a Task with another User, you and such other User form a Service Agreement directly between the two of you as set forth in more detail in Section 3 below.
                    </li>
                    <li>STUDENTS ARE INDEPENDENT BUSINESS OWNERS. STUDENTS ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OF CLIENTS AND NOT EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURERS, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OR FRANCHISEES OF SPAARROW. SPAARROW DOES NOT PERFORM TASKS AND DOES NOT EMPLOY INDIVIDUALS TO PERFORM TASKS. BY CONNECTING PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES SEEKING SERVICES WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS, SPAARROW OPERATES AS AN ONLINE MARKETPLACE THAT CONNECTS CLIENTS WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS (STUDENTS) WHO WISH TO PERFORM A VARIETY OF TASKS.

                    </li>
                    <li>USERS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SPAARROW DOES NOT SUPERVISE, SCOPE, DIRECT, CONTROL OR MONITOR A STUDENTS’S WORK AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS (TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW) ANY RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR THE WORK PERFORMED AND THE TASKS IN ANY MANNER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO A WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF GOOD AND WORKMANLIKE SERVICES, WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LAW, STATUTE, ORDINANCE, REGULATION, OR CODE.
                    </li>
                    <li>Any reference on the Spaarrow Platform to a Student being licensed or credentialed in some manner, or "badged," “reliable,” “reliability rate,” “elite,” “great value,” "background checked," “vetted” (or similar language) designations indicates only that the Student has completed a relevant account registration process or met certain criteria and does not represent anything else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Spaarrow of such Students’s skills or qualifications or whether they are licensed, insured, trustworthy, safe or suitable. Instead, any such description is intended to be useful information for Clients to evaluate when they make their own decisions about the identity and suitability of Students whom they select, interact, or contract with via the Spaarrow Platform.

                    </li>
                    <li>The Spaarrow Platform enables connections between Users for the fulfillment of Tasks. Spaarrow is not responsible for the performance or communications of Users, nor does it have control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of Tasks, Students, or Clients, nor of the integrity, responsibility, competence, qualifications, or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Users, or of any ratings or reviews provided by Users with respect to each other. Spaarrow makes no warranties or representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of the Tasks requested or services provided by, or the communications of or between, Users identified through the Spaarrow Platform, whether in public or private, via on- or off-line interactions, or otherwise howsoever.

                    </li>

                <h3>2. Student Background Checks and User Representations and Warranties
                </h3>
                <h3>Student Background Checks

                </h3>
                <p>Students may be subject to a review process before they can register for and during their use of the Spaarrow Platform, which may include but is not limited to identity verification and criminal background checks, using third party services as appropriate ( “Background Checks” ). Although Spaarrow may perform Background Checks, Spaarrow cannot confirm that any User is who they claim to be, and Spaarrow cannot and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of Background Check information.

                    When interacting with other Users, you should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety, data, and property, just as you would when interacting with other persons whom you don’t know. Spaarrow will not be liable for any false or misleading statements made by Users of the Spaarrow Platform.

                    NEITHER SPAARROW, NOR ITS PARENTS, AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS, INCLUDING THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, AGENTS, INVESTORS, SUBSIDIARIES, ATTORNEYS, REPRESENTATIVES, INSURERS, EMPLOYEES, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS “AFFILIATES” ) IS RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE CONDUCT, ACTS, OR OMISSIONS, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SPAARROW PLATFORM AND, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU HEREBY RELEASE SPAARROW AND AFFILIATES FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, OR DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED AND UNSUSPECTED, DISCLOSED AND UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE SPAARROW PLATFORM.

                </ul>
                <h3> 3. Contract between Clients and Students</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You acknowledge and agree that a legally binding contract with another User (the“ Service Agreement ” ) is formed when you and that User agree on the terms of a Task. The terms of the Service Agreement include the terms set forth in this Section 3, the engagement terms proposed and accepted on the Spaarrow Platform, and any other contractual terms accepted by both the Student and their Client to the extent such terms do not conflict with the terms in this Agreement, including this Section 3, and do not expand Spaarrow’s obligations or restrict Spaarrow’s rights under this Agreement. Sparrow is not a party to any Service Agreement and the formation of a Service Agreement will not, under any circumstances, create an employment or other service relationship between Spaarrow and the Student, nor will it create an employment relationship between the Client and the Student. Users do not have authority to enter into written or oral — whether implied or express — contracts on behalf of Spaarrow.

                    </li>
                    <li>Where approved in advance by the Client,the Student is not obligated to personally perform the Task. Taskers may engage assistants, helpers, subcontractors or other personnel (collectively “Student Assistants” ). For safety reasons, such Student Assistants shall have been registered through the Spaarrow Platform. A Student’s failure to comply with this provision shall be a violation of these Terms of Service and could lead to removal from the Spaarrow Platform. The Student assumes full and sole responsibility for the acts and omissions of such Student Assistants and is fully responsible for the lawful payment of all compensation, benefits and expenses of Student Assistants, if any, and for all required and applicable tax withholdings as to such Student Assistants. Clients are responsible for confirming with their Student that any Student Assistants are registered Students on the Spaarrow Platform.

                    </li>

                    <li>While using the Spaarrow Platform, Clients, in their sole discretion, determine whether they will be present or not when a Task is performed. Clients agree that if someone other than them books the Task on their behalf or is present in their stead when the Task is performed, they are appointing that person as their agent (“ Client’s Agent ” ) and the Student may take and follow direction from the Client’s Agent as if such direction was given from the Client him- or herself. If you are a Client’s Agent and accessing and using the Spaarrow Platform on behalf of a Client, you represent that you have the authority to act as their agent and to bind that person as the principal to all provisions of the Terms of Service. Client’s Agent may authorize any applicable waiver of the Client’s scoping, direction, or instruction of the Student’s work or performance of the Task in the Client’s stead. Client agrees that such direction and/or waiver is valid against Client and Client’s Agent, and Client shall be responsible and liable for all such direction and/or waiver as if made by Client him or herself. Client assumes full and sole responsibility for the acts and omissions of Client’s Agents. Client’s Agents are deemed third parties for the purposes of the Happiness Pledge and are thereby excluded from it.

                    </li>
                    <li>The Client shall pay their Student (s) in full for all Task services via the PSP as indicated on the Spaarrow Platform, at the rates agreed to by the parties in the Service Agreement. Each User agrees to comply with the Service Agreement and this Agreement during the engagement, performance and completion of a Task.
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <h3>4. Billing and Payment
                </h3>
                <p>Users of the Spaarrow Platform contract for Tasks directly with other Users. Spaarrow will not be a party to any contracts for Tasks or services. Client, and not Spaarrow, is responsible for payment for all Task services through the Spaarrow Platform.  Such payment must be made via the PSP. Spaarrow is not obligated to compensate Students for Client’s failure to pay for services.

                    The Task Payment, service charge, and Trust & Support fee must be paid through the PSP.  Clients on the Spaarrow Platform will be required to provide their payment method details to Spaarrow and the PSP. Students are responsible for accurately invoicing their Clients within 24 hours of the work being performed, even if the Task is not completed in its entirety or is designated as “ongoing”. Clients will be responsible for paying the invoice(s) for each Task (the “Invoice(s)” ), which will include (a) the pricing terms of the Task provided by the Tasker and agreed upon by the parties ( “Task Payment” ), (b) any out of pocket expenses agreed upon by the parties and submitted by the Tasker in connection with the Task,  (c) the service charge Spaarrow assesses to the Client for access to and information regarding Students, and (d) the Trust & Support Fee Sparrow assesses to the Client for customer support, and other various other services, or (e) cancellation charges, if applicable. In addition, a tip or gratuity, as applicable, may be added by the Client or at the Client’s direction to the Invoice(s), and all such tips or gratuities shall go directly to the Student. Clients may also be charged credit card processing fees equal to 3% of the aggregate expense amount if expenses related to a Task individually, or Tasks in the aggregate over a 30-day period, exceed $300 / 300£ / 300€, as applicable in your country. Student will be responsible for paying (i) registration fees, if applicable, and (ii) repayment of erroneous payments.

                    Students will be required to set up an account with the PSP, which may require any or all of the following: registration with the PSP, consent to the terms of service of the PSP, and completion of a vetting process and/or account validation at the request of the PSP. By accepting these Terms of Service, each Student agrees that they have downloaded or printed, and reviewed and agreed to, the PSP Services Agreement (the “PSP Services Agreement” ). Please note that Spaarrow is not a party to the PSP Services Agreement and that you, the PSP and any other parties listed in the PSP Services Agreement are the parties to the PSP Services Agreement and that Sparrow has no obligations, responsibility or liability to any Student or other party under the PSP Services Agreement.

                    To help prevent fraud and safeguard User information from the risk of unauthorized access, Spaarrow and/or the PSP may validate an account before activation and prior to each booking. As part of the validation process, temporary charges may be placed on the account associated with the User and then refunded within 1-5 business days.   This temporary charge may vary depending on the estimated value of the Task and expenses.

                    When Client receives confirmation through the Spaarrow Platform or via email that a Task has been completed, Client automatically authorizes the PSP to process the Invoice(s). Clients may be billed a one-hour cancellation charge as damages at the Student’s hourly rate through the PSP if you book a Task but cancel it before the scheduled time for performance.

                    Spaarrow reserves the right (but not the obligation) upon request from Client or Student, or upon notice of any potential fraud, unauthorized charges or other misuse of the Spaarrow Platform, to place on hold any Task Payment, out of pocket expenses, and/or tip or gratuity (if applicable), or refund or provide credits, or arrange for the PSP to do so.

                    Users of the Spaarrow Platform may be liable for any taxes or similar charges (including VAT, if applicable in the country where the Task is performed) required to be collected and/or paid on the Tasks and/or fees provided under the Agreement.

                    In certain jurisdictions, applicable rules may require that we collect or report tax and/or revenue information about you. You agree that Spaarrow may issue on your behalf receipts or similar documentation to facilitate accurate tax reporting.</p>
                <h3>5. Deactivation and Suspension
                </h3>
                <p>Spaarrow may suspend your right to use the Spaarrow Platform pending its investigation of a potential breach by you of this Agreement. Spaarrow may deactivate your account or limit your use of the Spaarrow Platform upon its determination that you breached a provision of this Agreement (a “User Breach” ). Spaarrow will provide you with written notice of its determination as required by law, unless we have reason to believe the User’s account has been compromised such that the notice would go to the wrong person, or notice would otherwise be counterproductive or would create a risk to safety .  If you wish to appeal this determination, please contact us within 14 days of receipt of such notice with the grounds for your appeal .

                    If Spaarrow suspends or deactivates your account or limits your use of the Spaarrow Platform pursuant to this Section 8, you are thereafter prohibited from registering and creating a new account under your name or business name, a fake or borrowed name, or the name of any third party, even if you may be acting on behalf of the third party.

                    Even after your right to use the Spaarrow Platform is suspended, terminated or limited, this Agreement will remain enforceable against you. Spaarrow reserves the right to take appropriate legal action pursuant to the Agreement.

                    Spaarrow reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any portion of the Spaarrow Platform at its sole discretion. Spaarrow will provide you with notice of any such modification or discontinuation as required by law. To the extent permitted by law, Spaarrow shall not be liable to you for any modification or discontinuance of all or any portion of the Spaarrow Platform. Spaarrow has the right to restrict anyone from completing registration as a Student if such person may threaten the safety and integrity of the Spaarrow Platform, or if such restriction is necessary to address any other reasonable business concern.

                    You may terminate this Agreement at any time by ceasing all use of the Spaarrow Platform and deactivating your account.</p>
                <h3>6. Spaarrow Operates as an Online Marketplace
                </h3>
                <p>Spaarrow operates as an online marketplace that connects Clients with service providers (Students) who wish to perform a variety of Tasks. Spaarrow does not perform Tasks and does not employ people to perform Tasks. Students operate as independent business owners and are customarily engaged in an independently established business of the same nature as that involved in the services performed for Clients through the Spaarrow Platform. Spaarrow does not control or direct the Students’ performance of their services or set their work locations, work hours, or terms of work. Students provide services under their own name or business name, and not under Spaarrow’s name. Students provide their own tools and supplies to perform their services; Spaarrow does not provide the tools or supplies. Students are free to maintain a clientele without any restrictions from Sparrow and are free to offer and provide their services elsewhere, including through competing platforms. Students are free to accept or reject Clients and contracts. Students are not penalized for rejecting Clients or contracts, though if Students accept a Client or contract through the Spaarrow Platform, they are expected to fulfill their contractual obligations to their client. Students set their own rates for services performed in the Spaarrow general marketplace, without deduction by Spaarrow.

                    The Spaarrow Platform is not an employment agency service or business and Sparrow is not an employer of any User. Students acknowledge and confirm that they are responsible for exercising their own business judgment in entering into Service Agreements and performing Tasks and that, depending on how they exercise such business judgment, there is a chance for individual profit or loss.</p>
                <h3>7. Account, Password, Security, and Telephone Communications
                </h3>
                <p>You must register with Spaarrow and create an account to use the Spaarrow Platform. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any log-in, password, and account number provided by you or given to you by Spaarrow for accessing the Spaarrow Platform. You are solely and fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account, even if not authorized by you. Spaarrow has no control over the use of any User’s account and expressly disclaims any liability derived therefrom. Should you suspect that any unauthorized party may be using your password or account or you suspect any other breach of security, you agree to notify Spaarrow immediately.

                    You acknowledge that telephone calls to or from Spaarrow, together with its agents and Affiliates, may be monitored and recorded for the purposes of quality control and training.

                    You verify that any contact information provided to Spaarrow, its agents and Affiliates, and Users, including, but not limited to, your name, business name, mailing address, email address, your residential or business telephone number, and/or your mobile telephone number, is true and accurate. You verify that you are the current subscriber or owner of any telephone number that you provide. You are strictly prohibited from providing a phone number that is not your own.

                <h3>8. Spaarrow “User Pledge”
                </h3>
                <p>The Spaarrow User Pledge applicable to the country where the Task is performed is part of this Agreement and incorporated by reference. Students determine which categories they are qualified to task in, and scope the Task directly with their Client. Spaarrow does not oversee, monitor or direct how a Student performs a Task, does not monitor Tasks or chat threads between Users, and does not otherwise assume responsibility for the actions of Users. Clients are advised to confirm with their Student that s/he is qualified to perform the Task prior to the Task taking place. Spaarrow is not liable for the acts or omissions of Users, nor does Spaarrow provide insurance against any losses sustained by Users. That said, Spaarrow wants Users to be happy about their experience using the Spaarrow Platform and the User Pledge is in place to encourage continued use of the Spaarrow Platform.

                    Payments made under the User Pledge are made at Spaarrow’s sole discretion, and are subject to certain conditions, limitations and exclusions, as described in the User Pledge. The User Pledge does not supersede any of the terms set forth in these Terms of Service or the Privacy Policy, including any of the limitations on liability set forth in these Terms of Service. In the unlikely event of a conflict with the User Pledge, these Terms of Service prevail over any contrary interpretation of the User Pledge. The User Pledge is not insurance and Spaarrow is not an insurer, as such terms are generally understood for regulatory purposes.</p>
                <h3>9. User Generated Content
                </h3>
                <p>“User Generated Content”  is defined as any information and materials you provide to Spaarrow, its agents, Affiliates, and corporate partners, or other Users in connection with your registration for and use of the Spaarrow Platform and participation in Spaarrow promotional campaigns, including without limitation the information and materials posted or transmitted for use in Public Areas. You are solely responsible for User Generated Content, and we act merely as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Generated Content. You acknowledge and agree that Spaarrow is not involved in the creation, development of User Generated Content, disclaims any responsibility for User Generated Content, and cannot be liable for claims arising out of or relating to User Generated Content. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Spaarrow has no obligation to monitor or review User Generated Content, but reserves the right to limit or remove User Generated Content if it is not compliant with the terms of this Agreement.

                    You hereby represent and warrant to Spaarrow that your User Generated Content (a) will not be false, inaccurate, incomplete or misleading; (b) will not be fraudulent or involve the transfer or sale of illegal, counterfeit or stolen items; (c) will not infringe on any third party’s privacy, or copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary right or rights of publicity or personality (to the extent recognized by law in the country where the Task is performed); (d) will not violate any law, statute, ordinance, code, or regulation (including without limitation those governing export control, consumer protection, unfair competition, anti-discrimination, incitement of hatred or false or misleading advertising, anti-spam or privacy); (e) will not be defamatory, libellous, malicious, threatening, or harassing; (f) will not be obscene or contain pornography (including but not limited to child pornography) or be harmful to minors; (g) will not contain any viruses, scripts such as Trojan Horses, SQL injections, worms, time bombs, corrupt files, cancelbots or other computer programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information; (h) will not claim or suggest in any way that you are employed or directly engaged by or affiliated with Spaarrow or otherwise purport to act as a representative or agent of Spaarrow; and (i) will not create liability for Spaarrow or cause Sparrow to lose (in whole or in part) the services of its Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or other partners or suppliers.

                    The Spaarrow Platform hosts User Generated Content relating to reviews and ratings of specific Taskers ( “Feedback” ). Feedback is such User’s opinion and not the opinion of Spaarrow, and has not been verified or approved by TaskRabbit. You agree that Spaarrow is not responsible or liable for any Feedback or other User Generated Content. Spaarrow encourages each User to give objective, constructive and honest Feedback about the other Users with whom they have transacted . Spaarrow is not obligated to investigate any remarks posted by Users for accuracy or reliability or to consider any statements or materials posted or submitted by Users about any Feedback but may do so at its discretion. You agree that Feedback enables Users to post and other Users to read about Users’ expression of their experiences and that you will not complain or take any action merely because you happen to disagree with such Feedback. You may request removal of a review that violates this Agreement by contacting the Support team. Each Client should undertake their own research prior to booking to be satisfied that a specific Student has the right qualifications for a Task.

                    Spaarrow respects the personal and other rights of others, and expects Users to do the same. Spaarrow is entitled to identify a User to other Users or to third parties who claim that their rights have been infringed by User Generated Content submitted by that User, so that they may attempt to resolve the claim directly.

                    If a User believes, in good faith, that any User Generated Content provided on or in connection with the Spaarrow Platform is objectionable or infringes any of its rights or the rights of others (e.g. counterfeiting, insult, invasion of privacy), the User is encouraged to notify Spaarrow. If a User discovers that User Generated Content promotes crimes against humanity, incites hatred and/or violence, or concerns child pornography, the User must notify Sparrow.</p>

                <h3>17. General Provisions
                </h3>
                <p>Failure by Spaarrow to enforce any provision(s) of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and Spaarrow with respect to its subject matter, and supersedes and governs any and all prior agreements or communications. The provisions of this Agreement are intended to be interpreted in a manner which makes them valid, legal, and enforceable. Except for the “Agreement Prohibiting Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” provision in the section applicable to U.S. Residents, in the event any provision is found to be partially or wholly invalid, illegal or unenforceable, (1) such provision shall be modified or restructured to the extent and in the manner necessary to render it valid, legal, and enforceable or, (2) if such provision cannot be so modified or restructured, it shall be excised from the Agreement without affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any of the remaining provisions. You hereby acknowledge and agree that we may assign or transfer this Agreement without your consent, including but not limited to assignments: (i) to a parent or subsidiary, (ii) to an acquirer of assets, or (iii) to any other successor or acquirer.

                </h3>
                <p>Students alone are responsible for identifying and obtaining any required licenses, permits, or registrations before offering services and undertaking Tasks. Indeed, certain types of Tasks and services may be prohibited altogether, and it is the responsibility of Students to avoid such prohibited Tasks and services. Penalties may include fines or other law enforcement. If you have questions about how national/ state/ provincial/ territorial and local laws apply to your Tasks and services on the Spaarrow Platform, you should first seek appropriate legal guidance.

                    Because Spaarrow does not supervise, scope, direct, control, or monitor a Student’s work or performance of Tasks, Clients must determine for themselves whether a Student has the skills and qualifications necessary to perform the specific Task at hand. Clients may wish to consult their national/state/provincial/territorial or local requirements to determine whether certain Tasks are required to be performed by a licensed or otherwise registered professional. Clients may also wish to discuss with their Student any specific hazards, obstacles, or impediments in the Task location (both visible and concealed) that may impact the performance of the Task.</p>
