            <p>Spaarrow reserves the right to disclose Personal Information from both private and public areas of the Spaarrow Platform in the absence of a court order, warrant, or subpoena, to the extent permitted by applicable law, if we are given reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that someone is causing injury to or interfering with the rights of Users, the general public, or Spaarrow or its partners, parents or affiliates.</p>

                It is our policy to provide notice to Users before producing their information in response to law enforcement requests unless

        <h3>6. Spaarrow's Information Retention Policy</h3>
        <div className="ml-1 mb-2">
            <p>We retain personal data for as long as you are a User in order to meet our contractual obligations to you, and for such longer period as may be in our legitimate interests and to comply with our legal obligations (see Exhibit A for exemplar document retention periods). We may also retain data from which you cannot directly be identified, for example where stored against a randomly-generated identifier so we know the data relates to a single User, but we cannot tell who that User is. We use this kind of data for research purposes and to help us develop and improve our services, and we take appropriate measures to ensure you cannot be re-identified from this data.</p>

        <h3>7. Spaarrow’s Security of Collected Information</h3>
        <div className="ml-1 mb-2">
            <p>Your Spaarrow account is password-protected so that only you and authorized Spaarrow staff have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone. Also, if you share a computer, you should sign out of your Spaarrow account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will help protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Spaarrow implements and maintains reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of information about you.
