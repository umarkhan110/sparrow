                        Spaarrow is a technology platform that allows Users to connect with each other so they can be their most productive selves. Students determine what categories they are qualified to task in, and scope the Task directly with their Client. Spaarrow does not oversee, monitor, or direct how a Student performs a Task, does not monitor Tasks or chat threads between Users, and does not otherwise assume responsibility for the actions of Users. Clients are advised to confirm with their Student that s/he is qualified to perform the Task prior to the Task taking place. Spaarrow is not liable for the acts or omissions of Users, nor does Spaarrow provide insurance against any losses sustained by Users. That said, Spaarrow wants Users to be happy about their experience using the Spaarrow Platform, and the User Pledge is in place to encourage continued use of the Spaarrow Platform.

                    <br />
                    <p>Spaarrow has the right to subrogate against any person or entity who may be responsible for causing the Losses giving rise to a Claim, including Users or any third party.
